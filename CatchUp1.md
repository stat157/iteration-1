===========
Hey guys~ How have you been doing~

I would like to update some summarized steps from Chris(the GSI) for what we should have achieved by now (just for record):

0. You should have these all installed: vagrant(definitely lol), git, ipython, ipython-notebook. 
    ('sodu apt-get install ____ '). AND you should also have 'Project1' directory created ('mkdir Project1').
1. start vagrant: code: 'vagrant up'
2. 'vagrant ssh'
3. get your ip address: 'ifconfig', look for inet addr ***.*.*.*
4. 'ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser. 
    Should appear that your ipython notebook is running or working or whatever that calls
5. go to your web browser, enter 'http://***.*.*.*:7777' and you should have your ipython notebook opened. 
    (7777 is edited by Chris on something called 'vim', im not sure for those of you who did not get that changed, you
    should try to figure out your 'four digits'). 

Another thing is about 'submitting' reflections. I have heard that we should fork the professor's 'reflections' repository first, and then post our reflections under that repository, and pull request to the professor after you have finished every reflection. Though the Kristina(the other GSI) is still asking the professor for further instructions on correct submission, there is no harm to folk and pull request your reflections starting this week. I suggest to copy and paste your old reflections on the repository forked from prof.
